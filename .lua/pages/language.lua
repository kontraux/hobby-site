        <h2>What's the lowdown on Lua?</h2>

        <p>
            Lua is a great language. If you aren't familiar, I recommend stopping by <a class="plinks" href="https://lua.org">Lua.org</a> to get
            and overview. I'm also using <a class="plinks" href="https://redbean.dev">redbean</a>, which is a very cool project, it's a lightweight
            web server that is portable- it runs on 6 operating systems!
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, redbean and Lua were natural choices for my site. I wanted a little bit of a DIY experience, and spinning up a server on Google Cloud and
            writing library.doItAllForMe() in Node.js or Python just seems a little bit against the spirit of the thing. Might as well use Squarespace, and
            at that point, may as well just have ChatGPT write a Facebook post for me. And since I wanted to put it on a x260 Thinkpad, I wanted something
            lightweight with high performance in case I get a visitor (stranger things can happen!). I'm definitely pleased with my choice, while redbean feels 
            more DIY it's not hard to use, really it's expertly designed, and the technology and philosophy behind it is really interesting.

            Lua really is just perfect for hobby coding. It has seen a lot of use in gaming and modding because it's quick to write and easy to sandbox, and 
            because it's so lightweight and fast, it's also used in mechatronics and robotics type stuff. There aren't many jobs with the title "Lua developer," 
            mostly the people who use it professionally are C developers and use it as an embedded\extension language. This leads a lot of people to think it's
            not as popular as it really is- it doesn't get a lot of libraries written for it, or articles written about it, but lots of people use it for
            small projects, scripts, or as a secondary language. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When I started coding, I was stoked on Python due to the syntax, but I was disappointed that it was just a wrapper for C libraries and pretty much 
            useless in other contexts due to the GIL and poor performance. If you're learning coding for fun and aren't looking for <s>dependency hell</s> drop-in
            solutions, Lua is definitely a good language to consider.
